This repository storges code and results for the paper "Geodesic Shape Regression based Deep Learning Segmentation for Assessing Longitudinal Hippocampal Atrophy in dementia Progression". The GeoLongSeg is a diffeomorphic geodesic guided deep learning method segment hippocampi in longitudinal 3T T1-weighted MRI data. The method mitigate longitudinal image error that unrelated to diseases by enhancing intra-individual morphological consistency.

The subjects list in our paper is in an excel fiel: Experiment data from ADNI.xlsx

The annotated data info is in Info of annoated data.xlsx

The data and codes will be uploaded soon.
